Due to version mismatches, the master code does not work with Ubuntu 18. In this repository, I have made the necessary changes to make it compatible with Ubuntu latest versions. The rest of the procedure remain the same as described by the original creator. Hope it helps someone :)

INTRODUCTION
------------
The IEEE 802.1ag standard is a set of protocols for Ethernet OAM
(Operations, Administration, and Management). The dot1ag-utils software
package is an Open Source (new BSD License) implementation of the
IEEE 802.1ag protocol and is supported on Arista Networks switches and
Linux, FreeBSD and MacOSX servers. It provides several debugging tools
that interact with IEEE 802.1ag enabled routers and switches. The package
implements a loopback message initiator (ethping), a link trace message
initiator (ethtrace) and a daemon (dot1agd) that responds to loopback
messages and link trace messages. Sending and receiving of continuity
check messages is implemented in the dot1ag_ccd daemon.

Currently, the dot1ag-utils implement the Down MEP functionality only.
The main focus at the moment is a setup where the dot1ag-utils are
run on an interface of a server which is connected to an Ethernet switch.

USE CASES
---------

(1) Ping and trace to Ethernet MAC addresses from a server.

(2) Connect a server to a switch and let the server respond to
Ethernet ping and trace messages.

                                   dot1agd
                                  +--------+
                                  | server |
                                  +---+----+
                                      | v1
   v1    +----------------+  v1   +---+----+  v1   +----------------+
---------+ 802.1ag switch +-------+ switch +-------+ 802.1ag switch +-----
         +----------------+       +--------+       +----------------+

The server is connected to the middle switch on VLAN v1. It can interact
with IEEE 802.1ag enabled switches. So you can L2 ping and trace to the
middle server (the server will respond) even though the switch does not
support 802.1ag itself.

When you also run the dot1ag_ccd daemon on the server, this setup can
send and receive continuity check messages too.

The advantage is that the server is connected to the switch at
L2 only. It does not need an IP address. So the security risk
is minimal. The server cannot be hacked via IP protocols.
